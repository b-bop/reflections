Using FC reduces the stress of version comparison and allows for ease of reverting back to older versions
Automated version control will allow for review without the necessity of renaming and the problem of opening all the old versions independently.
Manual Commits may be forgotten until the commit is too large.   Manual commits will minimize the actual number of versions that you need to plow through.   It will take some real trainning to standardize when I commit.
Becasue in programming multiple files are connected GIT must save all changes whereas with documents and such files are basically independent.
Git log and git diff seem to be very cumbersome. a better user interface would help not only the use but the understanding of this for people such as myself who are not going to use it every day.
Although tideous, reverting to see problem changes highlights those changes to help correct unintended errors
I want to use GIT with the android program course.
A new repository makes space for commits and generates other housekeeping files.
Staging area is for files that have changed but not yet committed in the repository
Use ogf GIT DIFF -- staged will show the changes for the commit.   This will help to make each commit a single change so it can be undone 
Branching coud be helpful for adding different modes of operation or for different equipment set ups.
Diagrams give physical picture to mental designs
Merging bring a branch back to the main program and resolves the conflicts.   This show the divernt branch as going back to the main program in the chart.
Automatic merge streamlines the process by showing where the conflicts are with the <<<<< mark in the merging file.
Why change a pull manually?   The program might not work and that would lead to confusion.
